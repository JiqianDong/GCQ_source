    """Converts observations from an environment with multiple observations for use in a neural network
    policy.

    In some cases, you have environments that return multiple different observations per timestep
    (in a robotics context, for example, a camera may be used to view the scene and a joint encoder may
    be used to report the angles for each joint). Usually, this can be handled by a policy that has
    multiple inputs, one for each modality. However, observations are returned by the environment
    in the form of a tuple `[(modality1_t, modality2_t, ..., modalityn_t) for t in T]` but the neural network
    expects them in per-modality batches like so: `[[modality1_1, ..., modality1_T], ..., [[modalityn_1, ..., modalityn_T]]`.
    This processor converts observations appropriate for this use case.

    # Arguments
        nb_inputs (integer): The number of inputs, that is different modalities, to be used.
            Your neural network that you use for the policy must have a corresponding number of
            inputs.

class Experiment:
    """
    Class for systematically running simulations in any supported simulator.

    This class acts as a runner for a network and environment. In order to use
    it to run an network and environment in the absence of a method specifying
    the actions of RL agents in the network, type the following:

        >>> from flow.envs import Env
        >>> flow_params = dict(...)  # see the examples in exp_config
        >>> exp = Experiment(flow_params)  # for some experiment configuration
        >>> exp.run(num_runs=1)

    If you wish to specify the actions of RL agents in the network, this may be
    done as follows:

        >>> rl_actions = lambda state: 0  # replace with something appropriate
        >>> exp.run(num_runs=1, rl_actions=rl_actions)

    Finally, if you would like to like to plot and visualize your results, this
    class can generate csv files from emission files produced by sumo. These
    files will contain the speeds, positions, edges, etc... of every vehicle
    in the network at every time step.

    In order to ensure that the simulator constructs an emission file, set the
    ``emission_path`` attribute in ``SimParams`` to some path.

        >>> from flow.core.params import SimParams
        >>> flow_params['sim'] = SimParams(emission_path="./data")

    Once you have included this in your environment, run your Experiment object
    as follows:

        >>> exp.run(num_runs=1, convert_to_csv=True)

    After the experiment is complete, look at the "./data" directory. There
    will be two files, one with the suffix .xml and another with the suffix
    .csv. The latter should be easily interpretable from any csv reader (e.g.
    Excel), and can be parsed using tools such as numpy and pandas.

    Attributes
    ----------
    custom_callables : dict < str, lambda >
        strings and lambda functions corresponding to some information we want
        to extract from the environment. The lambda will be called at each step
        to extract information from the env and it will be stored in a dict
        keyed by the str.

        the environment object the simulator will run
